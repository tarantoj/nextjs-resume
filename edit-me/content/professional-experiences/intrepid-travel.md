First professional software engineering job. Quickly became the SME in our migration to a new payments platform (.NET Framework).
Worked with an excellent team to build a new booking engine (.NET, SQL Server, React).
Eventually lead a team to develop a serverless BFF (AWS CDK, Lambda, Postgres) and CDN migration (Fastly, Terraform, Varnish).
